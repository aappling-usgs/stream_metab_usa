  FAKE It is well recognized that the climate is warming in response to anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases. Over the last decade, this has had a warming effect on lakes. Water clarity is also known to effect water temperature in lakes. What is unclear is how a warming climate might interact with changes in water clarity in lakes. As part of a project at the USGS Office of Water Information, several water clarity scenarios were simulated for lakes in Wisconsin to examine how changing water clarity interacts with climate change to affect lake temperatures at a broad scale.
  This data set contains the following parameters: year, WBIC, durStrat, max_schmidt_stability, mean_schmidt_stability_JAS, mean_schmidt_stability_July, SthermoD_mean_JAS, SthermoD_mean, lake_average_temp, peak_lake_average_temp, lake_average_temp_JAS, mean_epi_temp, mean_hypo_temp, mean_surf_temp, mean_bottom_temp, peak_surf_temp, peak_bottom_temp, mean_surf_temp_JAS, mean_bottom_temp_JAS, mean_bottom_temp_365, mean_surf_temp_365, mean_1m_temp, mean_surf_JA, GDD_wtr_5c, GDD_wtr_10c, volume_mean_m_3, simulation_length_days, mean_volumetric_temp, kd, out_val calculated for 2210 lakes
purpose: To bring metabolism data to the world!
