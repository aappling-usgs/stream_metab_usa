# ----data release----
title: Daily metabolism estimates and predictors

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Metabolism was estimated using the streamMetabolizer package (Appling et al. 2018) version 0.10.1 using the Bayesian model
  with streamMetabolizer model name "b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan", and using the site-specific configuration parameters
  and data sources specified in "Model configurations for estimating metabolism". Daily estimates were extracted
  from the models using the get_fit() function from streamMetabolizer and selecting the "daily" element from the
  resulting list. The variables site_name and resolution, which are constant within each model run, were appended
  to each table before concatenating the tables for all model runs.
  
  Several additional daily values were compiled from "Timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources,
  for estimating or interpreting metabolism". These values were DO.amp, light, discharge, and velocity; see
  "Entity and Attribute Information" in this file for details.
  
  The remaining daily values were computed from the sub-daily input data. These include DO.obs, DO.sat, DO.psat,
  depth, temp.water, and day.length; see "Entity and Attribute Information" in this file for details.
