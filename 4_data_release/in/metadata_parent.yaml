abstract: >-
  Estimates of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and gas exchange coefficients
  for 356 streams and rivers across the continental United States.
funding-credits: >-
  This work was funded by the USGS Powell Center (Working Group title: "Continental-scale overview of stream primary productivity, its links to water quality, and consequences for aquatic carbon biogeochemistry").
  Additional financial support came from the USGS NAWQA program and Office of Water Information.
  NSF grants DEB-1146283 and EF1442501 partially supported ROH.
  The USGS Wisconsin Modeling Center provided access to the HTCondor cluster for generating metabolism estimates.
purpose: To bring metabolism data to the world!
