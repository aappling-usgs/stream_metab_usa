abstract: >-
  This data release provides modeled estimates of 
  gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and gas exchange coefficients
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States.
  The release also includes the model input data and alternative input data,
  model fit and diagnostic information,
  spatial data for the modeled sites (catchment boundaries and site point locations), and
  potential predictors of metabolism such as discharge and light availability.
funding-credits: >-
  This work was funded by the USGS Powell Center
  (Working Group title: "Continental-scale overview of stream primary productivity,
  its links to water quality, and consequences for aquatic carbon biogeochemistry").
  Additional financial support came from the USGS NAWQA program and Office of Water Information.
  NSF grants DEB-1146283 and EF1442501 partially supported ROH.
  The USGS Wisconsin Modeling Center provided access to the HTCondor cluster for generating metabolism estimates.
purpose: >-
  A continental-scale quantification of energy flow in streams and rivers can facilitate better understanding of
  links between aquatic energy cycling and ecosystem services,
  the seasonality and dynamism of stream energy flow, and the effects of human activities on aquatic activity.
  This data release provides multi-day time series estimates of energy flow as
  metabolism (gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration)
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States.
