# ----data release----
title: Timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources, for estimating or interpreting metabolism
abstract: >-
  This dataset provides timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources.
  This compilation of data is intended for use in estimating or interpreting metabolism.
  Sites were included if they met the initial criteria of having at least 100 dissolved oxygen observations
  and one of the accepted NWIS site types ('ST','ST-CA','ST-DCH','ST-TS', or 'SP').
  
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of metabolism model inputs and outputs
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States (https://doi.org/10.5066/F70864KX).
  The complete release includes:
  modeled estimates of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and the gas exchange coefficient;
  model input data and alternative input data;
  model fit and diagnostic information;
  site catchment boundaries and site point locations; and
  potential predictors of metabolism such as discharge and light availability.

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Raw timeseries data were downloaded from two data sources: 
  
  Data on dissolved oxygen concentrations, water temperature, and discharge were downloaded from 
  the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System database (NWIS; see Source Citation for USGS_NWIS).
  
  Data on shortwave radiation and air pressure were downloaded from
  the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS; see Source Citation for NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002) and
  the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS; see Source Citation for GLDAS_NOAH025_3H_V2.0).
  
  Additional variables were calculated from these raw sources using data-preparation functions from the streamMetabolizer R package
  (see Source Citations for Appling et al. 2017, Garcia and Gordon 1992, and Raymond et al. 2012).

build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30)).
  
  Mac (x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0) and Windows (x86_64-w64-mingw32) computers were used to generate the data and metadata.
  
  R packages used: streamMetabolizer version 0.10.1; mda.streams version 0.10.4; sbtools version 1.1.6;
  dplyr version 0.7.4; magrittr version 1.5; meddle version 0.0.4; sbtools version 1.1.6; whisker version 0.3-2; yaml version 2.1.17.
file-format: >-
  Tab-separated values, one file per variable, up to 25 files per site, for 753 sites.
  Files for each site are packaged and compressed in .zip format.
