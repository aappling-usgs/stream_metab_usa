# ----data release----
title: Timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources, for estimating or interpreting metabolism

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Raw timeseries data were downloaded from two data sources: USGS NWIS and NASA LDAS.
  Additional variables were calculated from these raw sources using data-preparation functions from the streamMetabolizer R package.
process-date: 2017-01-01
data-name: nwis_SITENUM_timeseries.zip for 753 SITENUMs (NWIS site IDs)
data-description: >-
  Timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources, for estimating or interpreting metabolism.
  Sites were included if they met the initial criteria of having at least 100 NWIS dissolved oxygen observations
  and one of the accepted NWIS site types ('ST','ST-CA','ST-DCH','ST-TS', or 'SP').
build-environment: Combination of Windows and Mac personal computers, collected by scripts in the R programming language.
file-format: tab-separated values, one file per variable, up to 24 files (variables) per site, packaged and compressed in .zip format.
metadata-date: "`r format(Sys.time(),'%Y%m%d')"
