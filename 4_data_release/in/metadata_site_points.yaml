  Spatial tools in the R programming language were used to perform the operations of creating the spatial datasets and modifying attributes. 
  Station locations were accessed from the USGS National Water Information System's "site service": https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Service.html

  The USGS shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of these data, based on the description of 
  appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that these 
  data be directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources that may have changed 
  the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of 
  identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations. The USGS makes no claims for the data's 
  suitability for other purposes. The USGS should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived 
  from these data. The dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, 
  units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application 
  of the data.
