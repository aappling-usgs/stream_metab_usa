# ----data release----
title: Spatial site locations
abstract: >-
  This dataset provides site locations as shapefile points.
  
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of metabolism model inputs and outputs
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States (https://doi.org/10.5066/F70864KX).
  The complete release includes:
  modeled estimates of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and the gas exchange coefficient;
  model input data and alternative input data;
  model fit and diagnostic information;
  site catchment boundaries and site point locations; and
  potential predictors of metabolism such as discharge and light availability.

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >- 
  A points shapefile was created containing locations of the USGS gaging stations included in this data release. 
  Spatial tools in the R programming language were used to perform the operations of creating the spatial datasets and modifying attributes. 
  Station locations were accessed from the USGS National Water Information System's "site service": 
  https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Service.html. The R dataRetrieval package was used to access site service metadata 
  (function readNWISsite). Sites had one of two datums, NAD83 (EPSG code 4269) 
  or WGS84 (EPSG code 4326), and were transformed to a single datum (EPSG code 4326) using the rgdal package. The locations of each site
  were combined into a single output shapefile. Details for package versions used are found in the build environment details in Native Data Set Environment.

usage-rules:  >- 
  The USGS shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of these data, based on the description of 
  appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that these 
  data be directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources that may have changed 
  the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of 
  identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations. The USGS makes no claims for the data's 
  suitability for other purposes. The USGS should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived 
  from these data. The dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, 
  units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application 
  of the data.
accur-test: No formal attribute accuracy tests were conducted.
