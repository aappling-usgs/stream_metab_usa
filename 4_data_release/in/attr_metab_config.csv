resolution,"The temporal resolution of the input data (time between successive observations) for those dates fitted by this model. Expressed as XXmin, where XX is the number of minutes between observations and ""min"" indicates the units. This configuration file can be cross-referenced to the model fit zip files in this data release by concatenating ""site"" and ""resolution"" with an underscore and appending ""_fit.zip"", e.g., ""nwis_01473500_30min_fit.zip"".",This data release,12min,60min,minutes
required_timestep,"Duration of the expected timestep in days. This argument is passed to streamMetabolizer along with the complete input dataset; streamMetabolizer subsets the input data to only those observations that conform to the specified temporal resolution. Some sites have inconsistent temporal resolution over their periods of record, so dates with differing resolution were modeled separately and two or more models are possible for a single site.",streamMetabolizer R package,0.003472,0.04167,days
model_name,"The coded model name used to identify a unique model structure in the streamMetabolizer R package. Every model used b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan, a Bayesian (b) state-space model (oipi) with hierarchical partial pooling of gas exchange (Kb), trapezoid-rule numerical integration (tr), a linear relationship between productivity and light on each day (pl), constant respiration over each 24-hour period (rc), and gas exchange at each timestep computed from the modeled oxygen at the previous timestep (km).",streamMetabolizer R package,b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan,b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan,NA
K600_lnQ_nodes_centers,"R code to generate a sequence of values that span the range of natural logs of discharge at the site, at intervals of 0.2 natural log units. For ""seq(a,b,by=0.2)"", the generated sequence runs from a minimum of ""a"" to a maximum of ""b"". The piecewise linear hierarchical relationship between the natural logs of K600 (gas exchange rate coefficient) and Q (discharge) used these values as the x-axis endpoints of the line segments. The corresponding y values for K600 were fitted by the models.",streamMetabolizer R package,"seq(-0.1,2.1,by=0.2)","seq(8.1,10.7,by=0.2)",natural log of discharge where discharge is m^3 s^-1

K600_daily_sigma_sigma,"Hyperparameter describing the expected deviation of daily K600 estimates (K600_daily) from the value predicted by the piecewise linear relationship for that day (K600_daily_piecewise). The parameter described by this hyperparameter is K600_daily_sigma, which is used as K600_daily ~ normal(mu=K600_daily_piecewise, sigma=K600_daily_sigma). This hyperparameter is the scale (= sigma) parameter of a half-normal prior distribution of K600_daily_sigma such that K600_daily_sigma ~ halfnormal(mu=0, sigma=K600_daily_sigma_sigma). The value of K600_daily_sigma_sigma for each model was selected based on a round of preliminary maximum-likelihood estimates of K600 at each site and is equal to 2 percent of the median of those estimates.",streamMetabolizer R package,0.01,1,NA

depth.src,"The data sources and computation method used to estimate water depth for use in modeling metabolism. Depth estimates always began with discharge data from USGS National Water Information System, https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis. One of two calculation methods was used for each model. If regionalized hydraulic geometry coefficients were available for the site (see the ""Site identifiers and details"" table in this data release), then the ""calcDischHarvey"" algorithm applied those coefficients to the discharge data using the formula z=cQ^f where z is depth (m), c (m) and f (unitless) are the supplied coefficients, and Q is discharge (m^3 s^-1). If regionalized coefficients were unavailable for the site, then the ""calcDischRaymond"" algorithm was applied via the ""calc_depth"" streamMetabolizer function, which fixes the coefficients in the above equation at c=0.409 and f=0.294 according to a global regression by Raymond et al. 2012.",This data release,calcDischHarvey,calcDischRaymond,NA
