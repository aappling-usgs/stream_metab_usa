# ----data release----
title: Input data used for estimating metabolism
abstract: >-
  This dataset provides input data in the format used for estimating metabolism.
  
  This dataset is part of a larger data release that provides modeled estimates of
  gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and gas exchange coefficients
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States.
  The release also includes the model input data and alternative input data,
  model fit and diagnostic information,
  spatial data for the modeled sites (catchment boundaries and site point locations), and
  potential predictors of metabolism such as discharge and light availability.

process-description: >-
  These input files were used to estimate metabolism, in combination with the configuration
  parameters given in the "Model configurations for estimating metabolism" table in this data release.
  These input files are properly formatted for use with the streamMetabolizer modeling package (Appling et al. 2018).
  
  The streamMetabolizer package requires as input a single table with the following variables in columns: the solar
  mean time (solar.time), dissolved oxygen concentration (DO.obs), hypothetical dissolved oxygen concentration at saturation (DO.sat),
  stream depth averaged over the full length and width of the upstream reach that affects dissolved oxygen concentrations (depth), 
  water temperature (temp.water), photosynthetically active radiation as photon flux density (light), and river discharge (discharge).
  To generate this table, we selected and merged the best available timeseries data for each site,
  where the possible sources for each variable were those timeseries variables provided in
  "Timeseries data collected or computed from outside sources, for estimating or interpreting metabolism" in this data release.
  "Best available" always meant sitetime_calcLon for solar.time, doobs_nwis for DO.obs, dosat_calcGGbts for DO.sat, 
  wtr_nwis for temp.water, par_calcLatSw for light, and disch_nwis for discharge.
  "Best available" meant depth_calcDischHarvey for 423 models and depth_calcDischRaymond for the remaining 10 models
  (for which depth_calcDischHarvey was unavailable).

  To merge the data, we began with the DO.obs observations and associated solar.time values. 
  We then matched the other variables to those solar.time values, linearly interpolating among observations for variables
  that had not-quite-matching timestamps. We limited linear interpolation to mismatches or data gaps of no more than 3 hours;
  entire data rows were excluded for any time points during which one or more variables had a data gap greater than 3 hours.
