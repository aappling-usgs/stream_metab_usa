# ----data release----
title: "Metabolism estimates for 356 U.S. rivers (2007-2017): 6. Model outputs"
abstract: >-
  This dataset provides complete fits from metabolism estimation models.
  The format is 5 files per model (text and tab-delimited files, packaged as 1 zip file per model):
  (1) estimates of daily gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and the gas exchange coefficient (K600),
  (2) parameters for the model overall,
  (3) estimates of the nodes defining the piecewise line relating K600 to discharge,
  (4) parameters for the overall relationship between K600 and discharge, and
  (5) any warnings returned by the model.
  
  
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of metabolism model inputs and outputs
  for 356 streams and rivers across the United States (https://doi.org/10.5066/F70864KX).
  The complete release includes:
  modeled estimates of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and the gas exchange coefficient;
  model input data and alternative input data;
  model fit and diagnostic information;
  site catchment boundaries and site point locations; and
  potential predictors of metabolism such as discharge and light availability.

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Metabolism was estimated using the streamMetabolizer package (Appling et al. 2017, 2018) version 0.10.1 using the Bayesian model
  with streamMetabolizer model name "b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan", and using the site-specific configuration parameters
  and data sources specified in "Model configurations for estimating metabolism". Parameter estimates and diagnostics
  were extracted from the models using the get_fit() function from streamMetabolizer. Each element of the resulting list
  was written to a separate tab-separated text file, then the set of files for each model was compressed into a zip file for release.
process-date: 20170406
build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30)).
  
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was Windows (x86_64-w64-mingw32).
  
  R packages used: streamMetabolizer version 0.10.1; dplyr version 0.7.4; magrittr version 1.5;
  meddle version 0.0.4; sbtools version 1.1.6; whisker version 0.3-2; yaml version 2.1.17.
file-format: >-
  Tab-separated values and text files, 4 to 5 files per model.
  The files for each model are packaged and compressed in .zip format. The zip files are named with the pattern
  "nwis_SITENUM_RES_fit.zip" for the 433 combinations of SITENUM (USGS site IDs) and RES (temporal resolution of input data, minutes).
metadata-date: !expr format(Sys.time(),'%Y%m%d')
accur-test: No formal attribute accuracy tests were conducted.
