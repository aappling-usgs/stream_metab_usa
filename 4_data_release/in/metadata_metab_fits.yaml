# ----data release----
title: Complete fits from metabolism estimation models

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Metabolism was estimated using the streamMetabolizer package (Appling et al. 2017, 2018) version 0.10.1 using the Bayesian model
  with streamMetabolizer model name "b_Kb_oipi_tr_plrckm.stan", and using the site-specific configuration parameters
  and data sources specified in "Model configurations for estimating metabolism". Parameter estimates and diagnostics
  were extracted from the models using the get_fit() function from streamMetabolizer. Each element of the resulting list
  was written to a separate tab-separated text file, then the set of files for each model was compressed into a zip file for release.
process-date: 20170406
data-name: nwis_SITENUM_RES_fit.zip for 433 combinations of SITENUM (USGS site IDs) and RES (temporal resolution of input data, minutes).
data-description: Model results from estimating metabolism.
build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30)).
  
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was x86_64-w64-mingw32.
  
  R packages loaded into this environment: streamMetabolizer, version: 0.10.1; dplyr, version: 0.7.4.
file-format: tab-separated values and text files, 5 files per SITENUM_RES combination, packaged and compressed in .zip format.
metadata-date: "`r format(Sys.time(),'%Y%m%d')"
