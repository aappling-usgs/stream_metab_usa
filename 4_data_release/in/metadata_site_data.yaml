process-description: >- 
  The fields site_name, nwis_id, long_name, lat, lon, coord_datum, alt, alt_datum, and site_type 
  are site-specific metadata extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS)
  National Water Information System's (NWIS; see Source Citation for USGS_NWIS) 
  site service https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Service.html
  and usually correspond to the fields from that service of: 
  site_no (prefixed here with "nwis_"), site_no (without prefix),
  station_nm, dec_lat_va, dec_long_va, dec_coord_datum_cd, alt_va, and alt_datum_cd.
  The only exceptions are for sites for which dec_lat_va and dec_lon_va were unavailable in the NWIS database, 
  in which case we parsed coordinate information from NWIS fields lat_va, long_va, and coord_datum_cd into the
  decimal coordinate format of other sites.
  
  The field nhdplus_id links USGS sites to corresponding reach codes (ComID's) in the
  National Hydrography Dataset, Version 2 (see Source Citation for NHDPlusV2). 
  The nhdplus_id is the ComID of the NHDPlusV2 reach for which the centerpoint
  latitude and longitude most closely match the latitude and longitude of each USGS site;
  locations were matched using a combination of automated and visual inspection of maps and flowlines.
  
  The fields dvqcoefs.c, dvqcoefs.f, dvqcoefs.a, dvqcoefs.b, dvqcoefs.k, dvqcoefs.m are hydraulic geometry
  coefficients describing the relationships among river discharge, velocity, width, and depth.
  These were obtained from an analysis by Gomez-Velez et al. 2015 (see Source Citation). 
  The data used in that analysis were measurements of instantaneous low-flow and bankfull depths and widths
  made at several thousand sites in the conterminous US
  
  
  
  \cite{u.s.environmentalprotectionagency_thewadeable_2006,u.s.environmentalprotectionagency_national_2013a}.
  \citep{gomez-velez_denitrification_2015} correlated depths and widths with the
  cumulative drainage area reported in NHDPlusV2
  to create standard power law relationships describing downstream changes in hydraulic geometry.
  The relationships were regionalized at the HUC2 (USGS Hydrologic Unit Code 2) level.
  Downstream hydraulic geometry equations were then developed for two flow frequencies,
  baseflow and bankfull conditions, which permitted at-a-station hydraulic geometry relationships
  to be developed by fitting power laws to depth and width as functions of discharge for which the
  fitted power law could be used to compute depth and width for any discharge value in the timeseries
  at the NWIS sites where metabolism was estimated.
