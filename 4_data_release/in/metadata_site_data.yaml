process-description: >- 
  1. The fields site_name, nwis_id, long_name, lat, lon, coord_datum, alt, alt_datum, and site_type 
  are site-specific metadata extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS)
  National Water Information System's (NWIS; see Source Citation for USGS_NWIS) 
  site service https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/Site-Service.html
  and usually correspond to the fields from that service of: 
  site_no (prefixed here with "nwis_"), site_no (without prefix),
  station_nm, dec_lat_va, dec_long_va, dec_coord_datum_cd, site_tp_cd (called "site_type" here), alt_va, and alt_datum_cd.
  The only exceptions are for sites for which dec_lat_va and dec_lon_va were unavailable in the NWIS database, 
  in which case we parsed coordinate information from NWIS fields lat_va, long_va, and coord_datum_cd into the
  decimal coordinate format of other sites. Despite these values originating from the NWIS site service, we did manually 
  evaluate accuracy of many fields, and found some "0" values in alt_va to be suspect. Caution is encouraged for using the 
  alt_va field. 
  
  2. The field nhdplus_id links USGS sites to corresponding reach codes (ComID's) in the
  National Hydrography Dataset, Version 2 (see Source Citation for NHDPlusV2). 
  The nhdplus_id is the ComID of the NHDPlusV2 reach for which the centerpoint
  latitude and longitude most closely match the latitude and longitude of each USGS site;
  locations were matched using a combination of automated and visual inspection of maps and flowlines.
  
  3. The fields dvqcoefs.c, dvqcoefs.f, dvqcoefs.a, dvqcoefs.b, dvqcoefs.k, dvqcoefs.m are hydraulic geometry
  coefficients describing the at-a-station relationships among river discharge, velocity, width, and depth.
  These were obtained from an analysis by Gomez-Velez et al. 2015 (see Source Citation) and
  are regionalized at the HUC2 (USGS Hydrologic Unit Code 2) level based on several thousand
  measurements of instantaneous low-flow and bankful depths and widths in the conterminous United States.
  
  4. The fields struct.canal_flag, struct.dam_flag, struct.npdes_flag are flags for likely site suitability
  for metabolism modeling, based on site proximity to infrastructure that could affect metabolism estimates.
  
  4a. The flagging focused on three feature types: 
  permitted National Pollution Discharge Elimination System point sources (see USEPA_NPDES in Source Citations),
  dams identified in the National Inventory of Dams (USACE_NID),
  and canals and ditches identified in the National Hydrography Database (NHDPlusV2).
  National data layers for these features of interest were clipped to watersheds upstream of the sites in our dataset.
  The geodetic distance between each stream monitoring site and the nearest upstream feature of each type was calculated using
  the function GenerateNearTable in the arcpy library in Python 3.6.
  
  4b. The mean 80% oxygen turnover distance on each day was computed from the mean 95% oxygen turnover distance
  (DO.tdist95 in "Daily metabolism estimates and predictors") by multiplying by -ln(0.2)/-ln(0.05).
  The 50th, 80th, and 95th percentiles of the daily 80% turnover distances were then computed for each site.
  
  4c. Distances between the site and upstream features were compared with the percentiles of 80% O2 turnover distance.
  Site flags are numeric to indicate whether the nearest feature of each type was farther than the 95th, 80th, 50th, or 0th percentile;
  those four cases are represented by site flag values of 95, 80, 50, or 0, respectively,
  such that a value of 95 indicates the least probable interference from a structure of a given type.
