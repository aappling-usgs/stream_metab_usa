K600_daily_sigma_Rhat,"Gelman-Rubin convergence statistic (R-hat statistic) of the MCMC sampling for the K600_daily_sigma parameter, giving the fitted estimate of the standard deviation of K600_daily values relative to the exp(K600_daily_predlog) values on the same dates.

err_proc_iid_sigma_Rhat,"Gelman-Rubin convergence statistic (R-hat statistic) of the MCMC sampling for the err_proc_iid_sigma parameter, giving the fitted standard deviation of process errors (differences between rates of oxygen concentration change as modeled by the overall state-space model and the deterministic component of the model).
