# ----data release----
title: Key diagnostics and overall assessments of metabolism model performance

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Metabolism was estimated using the streamMetabolizer package (Appling et al. 2018), and these key diagnostics and assessments were derived from the model outputs.
  Raw outputs and additional diagnostics are available in the "fit" output files included in this data release.
