# ----data release----
title: Key diagnostics and overall assessments of metabolism model performance

# ----dataset details----
process-description: >-
  Metabolism was estimated using the streamMetabolizer package (Appling et al. 2017, 2018), 
  then key diagnostics and assessments were derived from the model outputs.
  Raw outputs and additional diagnostics are available in the "fit" output files included in this data release.
  
  A final automated model assessment of High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L) overall confidence in each model
  was computed from these key diagnostics using a decision tree:
  Models were assigned Low confidence if K600_daily_sigma_Rhat > 1.2, err_proc_iid_sigma_Rhat > 1.2, K_range > 50, neg_GPP > 50, and/or pos_ER > 50.
  Models were assigned Medium confidence if they were not assigned Low confidence, and K_range > 15, neg_GPP, and/or pos_ER > 25.
  Models were assigned High confidence if they were not assigned Low or Medium confidence.
  
  This overall assessment is based only on readily computable information and is intended only
  as guidance, such that an expert familiar with the oxygen data
  and site characteristics could reasonably override the assessment given here.

build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.4.3 (2017-11-30)).
  
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was x86_64-w64-mingw32.
  
  R packages loaded into this environment: streamMetabolizer, version: 0.10.1; dplyr, version: 0.7.4.
