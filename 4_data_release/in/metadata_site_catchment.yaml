# ----data release----
title: Spatial catchments


# ----dataset details----
process-description: >- 
  Existing polygons were combined from various sources (see data_source attribute and Source Information).
  Spatial tools in the R programming language were used to perform the operations of merging 
  and modifying attributes. 
process-date: "`r format(Sys.time(),'%Y%m%d')`"
data-name: Spatial data for catchment delineation
data-description: >- 
  Catchment polygons from various sources collated into a single shapefile.
  Catchments approximately represent the contributing area for gaging stations. 
  Not all stations had catchments delineated, so those included here are a subset of the total. 
build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.4.1 (2017-06-30)).

usage-rules:  >- 
  The USGS shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of these data, based on the description of 
  appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that these 
  data be directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources that may have changed 
  the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of 
  identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations. The USGS makes no claims for the data's 
  suitability for other purposes. The USGS should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived 
  from these data. The dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, 
  units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application 
  of the data.
