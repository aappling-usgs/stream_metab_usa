## Overview

The workflow is documented and enforced in the [makefile](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/stream_metab_usa/blob/master/makefile) file, which can be run with a call to `make` from the command line, or using Ctrl-Shift-B in RStudio. At least, we would like this to be true; in practice, there's lots of babysitting of loops through web API calls and computing clusters. Still, the [makefile](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/stream_metab_usa/blob/master/makefile) should give you an idea of how we want things to flow.

## Dependencies

The main package dependencies for the stream_metab_usa R project are `sbtools`, `dataRetrieval`, `geoknife`, and `mda.streams`. To install all four of these, see the installation instructions in [the `mda.streams` repository's README](https://github.com/USGS-R/mda.streams/blob/develop/README.md#first-time-installation).
