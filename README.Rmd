# stream_metab_usa

These are the package dependencies for the stream_metab_usa R project.
```{r}
library(sbtools)
library(mda.streams)
library(powstreams)
```

Note: Package dependencies required for this project come from both the CRAN 
and USGS repositories. To install them, execute the following code chunk, 
then build the sbtools, mda.streams, and powstreams packages from within 
their respective local repositories (or directly from GitHub using 
install_github()).

```{r}
install.packages(
 c("dataRetrieval", "R.utils", "geoknife"), 
 repos=c("http://owi.usgs.gov/R","http://cran.us.r-project.org"),
 dependencies=TRUE,
 type="both")
```

The workflow is documented and enforced in 'makefile', which can be run with a call to `make` from the command line, or using Ctrl-Shift-B in RStudio. At least, we would like this to be true; in practice, there's lots of babysitting of loops through web API calls and computing clusters. Still, the makefile should give you an idea of how we want things to flow.
This project contains the core data management scripts of the USGS Powell Center working group on continental-scale stream metabolism.

## Overview

The workflow is documented and enforced in the [makefile](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/stream_metab_usa/blob/master/makefile) file, which can be run with a call to `make` from the command line, or using Ctrl-Shift-B in RStudio. At least, we would like this to be true; in practice, there's lots of babysitting of loops through web API calls and computing clusters. Still, the [makefile](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/stream_metab_usa/blob/master/makefile) should give you an idea of how we want things to flow.

## Dependencies

The main package dependencies for the stream_metab_usa R project are `sbtools`, `dataRetrieval`, `geoknife`, and `mda.streams`. To install all four of these, see the installation instructions in [the `mda.streams` repository's README](https://github.com/USGS-R/mda.streams/blob/develop/README.md#first-time-installation).
